Welcome to JLB Design Blog! In this first post, we'll explore some fundamental design principles that every web developer should keep in mind.

## 1. User-Centered Design

Always prioritize the user experience. Your design should be intuitive and serve the user's needs first.

## 2. Simplicity and Clarity

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci

Clean, uncluttered designs communicate more effectively than complex ones.

## 3. Consistency

Maintain consistency in:
- Color schemes
- Typography
- Navigation patterns
- UI components

## 4. Accessibility

Ensure your designs are accessible to users with disabilities:

```css
/* Example: High contrast colors */
.button {
  background-color: #0066cc;
  color: #ffffff;
  border: 2px solid #004499;
}
```

## 5. Mobile-First Approach

Design for mobile devices first, then scale up for larger screens.
